# Sickmoviez (mock IMDb)

A mock-IMDb website I worked on with a group as a class project. The website (no longer hosted) interfaced with a MongoDB instance and provided functionality to search the database and view information about both movies and actors and also allowed for user login and registration and the ability for users to add movies to a list of favorites.

It was in-part my responsibility to develop the back-end of the website, so all of the Express JS code (app.js, routes/*, and schemas/* was written jointly by me and another partner. I have included the front-end HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that was provided by another member of my group for completeness.
